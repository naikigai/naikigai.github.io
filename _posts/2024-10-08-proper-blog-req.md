## Requirements of a Proper Blog

Pros in this blog :
- Easy editing from github.
- Free hosting
- Image pasting and uploading easy
- Link pasting easy
  
Cons:
- No auth everything is public
- No direct editing on website which could be done if auth is there.
- No tags
- No search
- No comments
- Basically no proper backend/DB only
- No backup of files
- Not sure if blogs can be put into folders , this could have been done without the above cons as well.

Need to address the above cons
